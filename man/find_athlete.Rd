\title{Find Athlete URL}
\usage{
find_athlete(athlete_name)
}
\arguments{
\item{athlete_name}{A character string representing the full name of the athlete whose
results URL is to be retrieved.}
}
\value{
A character string containing the URL to the athlete's results. If the athlete is not found, returns \code{NA}.
}
\description{
Given an athlete's full name, this function retrieves the results URL from the
\code{olympic_results} dataset included in the \code{blue} package. It performs an exact match on the name,
and returns the first matching URL. If no match is found, it returns \code{NA} and issues a warning.
}
\details{
The function uses the \code{olympic_results.rda} dataset (saved with \code{usethis::use_data()}) as the lookup source.
This is the preferred method for accessing embedded package data rather than reading from a raw CSV file.
}
\examples{
find_athlete("Álvaro MARTÍN")
find_athlete("Massimo STANO")
find_athlete("Jane Doe")  # Will return NA and issue a warning
}
